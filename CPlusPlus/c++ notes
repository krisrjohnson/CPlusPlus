compiler ignores all whitespace (doesn't seem 100% true)
 line using namespace std; tells the compiler to use the std (standard) namespace, features of C++ Standard library

cout is used in combination with the insertion operator. Write the insertion operator as << to insert the data that comes after it into the stream that comes before.
You can have multiple statements on a single line, as long as you remember to end each statement with a semicolon. 
The line return 0; terminates the main() function, returning the value 0 to the calling process. A non-zero value (usually of 1) signals abnormal termination. If the return statement is left off, the C++ compiler implicitly inserts "return 0;" to the end of the main() function.

variables are case sensitive, must be declared before use
int a,b; // is valid
a=10;b=20;int sum = a + b; // valid

>> // extractor operator
cin >> num // user inputs a num

integer division drops remainders
+=, -=, *=, /=, %= (what use case of %=?)
++x, or x++ // increment by 1, prefix/postfix affects order
use case:
x = 5;
y = x++; // y is 5, x is 6
z = ++x; // z and x evalute to 7

if(test) {} // if stmt syntax
while(condition) {}
for(int x = 1; x < 10; x++) {}
do {} while(condition); 
/* if while(false), do block still runs once. So do...while runs at least once */

switch(expression) {
  case value1:
	stmts;
	break;
  case value2:
	stmts;
	break;
  default: // must appear at the end
    stmts;
} /* break can be ommitted if you wish to test all the cases, or certain consecutive cases */

'a' // char
"a" // string literal
int // min size is 4 bytes on modern sys architectures
/* mods: signed, unsigned, short, long -negatives allowed, no negs, half size, double size*/
float // always signed, three types: float, double, long double // 4, 8, 16 bytes
#include <string>
#include <iostream> // contains string
char // 1-byte int as an ascii

Pascal vs caMel case - BackColor vs backColor

int b[5] = {11, 45, 62, 70, 88}; /* array of 5 int elements initialized as 11, 45, 62, 70, and 88. If the 5 in [5] is ommitted, code will form an array of len equal to elements provided. 0 indexed. Access same as python, cout << b[3] // outputs 70 */

int x[3][4] // integer array of 3 rows x 4 columns, so 12 slots
similarly can declare using arrays:
int x[2][3] = {
	{2,3,4},
	{8,9,10}
}

int score = 5;
cout << &score << endl; // &score is the pointer to the memory address of var score: 0x29fee8
/* pointers are themselves variables! So &score itself has its own memory location. pointers are of type long hexadecimal. & means address-of	 */
int *ip; // pointer to an integer
char *ch; // pointer to a char

int score = 7;
int *pscore = &score; 
cout << *pscore << endl; // dereference pscore using asterisk. Outputs 7;


Dynamic memory:
stack - local vars take up mem on stack
heap - unused prog memory that can be dynamically used when prog runs
new int; // allocates mem at runtime within the heap, returns mem address
int *p = new int; *p = 5; /* pointer p is created in the stack as local var, holds allocated heap address, value of 5 is stored in the heap at that address */

/* on stack memory managed automatically. On heap, have to manually handle dynamic mem alloc. Use delete pointer to release the heap mem. This will not delete the pointer variable on the stack. Use a NULL pointer when initializing a pointer as std best practices; int *p = NULL; */
int *p = NULL;
p = new int[20]; // request array of memory
delete [] p; // release the array of memory

cout << sizeof(char) << endl; // returns 1, int: 4, float: 4, double: 8, var: 4 // 
int numbers[100];
cout << sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]); /* shows number of elements in an array (in case it wasn't known) */
