compiler ignores all whitespace (doesn't seem 100% true)
 line using namespace std; tells the compiler to use the std (standard) namespace, features of C++ Standard library

cout is used in combination with the insertion operator. Write the insertion operator as << to insert the data that comes after it into the stream that comes before.
You can have multiple statements on a single line, as long as you remember to end each statement with a semicolon. 
The line return 0; terminates the main() function, returning the value 0 to the calling process. A non-zero value (usually of 1) signals abnormal termination. If the return statement is left off, the C++ compiler implicitly inserts "return 0;" to the end of the main() function.

variables are case sensitive, must be declared before use
int a,b; // is valid
a=10;b=20;int sum = a + b; // valid
